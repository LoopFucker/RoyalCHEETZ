## Preface
Full Fortnite project files for External.
 
This is ready-to-use cheat, it has lot of core features and has no issues.

## FAQ
### Where's the EXE?
We provide a binary in release tab. Look to the right

### How do I add a hitmarker sound?
Create a **hitsounds** folder inside the **base** Fortnite directory.
Place as many **.wav** sound files as you want inside of it. Load the cheat and they will be under the hitsounds combobox.

### Where are config files stored?
Profiles are stored inside the **base** Fortnite directory under a folder named **profiles**.

You can share profiles with friends by navigating to the configuration tab inside the cheat and selecting **Export**. This will copy all profile data to the clipboard which you can then paste to a friend.

To import a profile, just copy all of the profile data and press **Import**. Make sure to save your profile by entering a name and pressing **Save**.

### Why does moving the menu crash the game?
Disable multi-core rendering in your Fortnite video settings.

### How do I open the menu?
Press `INSERT`.

### How do I unload the cheat?
Press `END`.

### How do i setup? 
to set up, just download or compile the cheat, and run it. Now as this does take over some aspects of your computer like fortnite files, and keyboard and mouse to use cheats like aimbot and ESP, you will need to turn off antivirus. 
this is a common practice for almost every single forntite cheat. So don't cry if it shows as a trojan! For some utilities, admin rights will be required.
